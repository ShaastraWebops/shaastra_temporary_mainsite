<center><h3> Dave Lavery </h3></center><br>
<p>"I wanted to work for NASA since I was a little boy. Like any kid in the '60s, my heroes were Neil Armstrong, John Glenn and Chuck Yeager."
Even though poor eyesight ended his hopes of becoming an astronaut, Dave Lavery didn't give up his dream of space exploration. Today he is the Program Executive for Solar System Explorations NASA, although you might recognize him better as the man who led the Curiosity mission to Mars. In his capacity of Program Executive, he handles the responsibilities of several Mars missions at once. Lavery took up a job in NASA right after completing a degree in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, and has come a long way since. He has also played a role in advancing robotic education by being involved with the FIRST Robotics Competition as a mentor, while being a member of the FRC Game Design Committee. His twitter handle, apart from describing him as a NASA geek, robot advocate and "Mars guy", also declares his interest in mountaineering and cycling.
