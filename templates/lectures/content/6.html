<strong>We are delighted to invite Dr. Sinha, an eminent physicist working on nuclear and high energy physics, to Shaastra this year. He is a Padma Bhushan awardee as well as the Homi Bhabha Chair Professor of the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, unarguably one of the finer scientific minds in India. </strong>
