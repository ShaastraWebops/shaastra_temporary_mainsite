<p>Sharmila Bhattacharya, head of the Biomodel Performance and Behaviour Laboratory at NASA Ames Research Center, is a leading researcher in  immune system changes during spaceflight and the effects of radiation and altered gravity on living systems. She was the principal investigator for the space shuttle flight experiment, Fly Immunity and Tumors (FIT), which flew in 2006. She holds masters and doctorate degrees in molecular biology from Princeton University and has conducted post-doctoral research in neurobiology at Stanford University. 

She believes that to work hard on something that truly interests you is the only way to build a lifelong career that is fulfilling and challenging. In her own life her biggest success has been seeing her experiments flown in space, a dream of flight fuelled by her father, a pilot, who told her that being a girl would not stop her  from being "absolutely anything" she wanted to be.
