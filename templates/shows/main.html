                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The work of science can be enigmatic deceiving your eyes by showing animations with just a strip of LEDs. You will know which boxes to blame if you are unable to get sleep that night. Instrumentalists will be seen throwing their guitars and drum-sticks in their backyard after witnessing the Wireless Instruments. DJs will seem clich√© after you are mesmerized by Virtual Music Mixing. You will be pinching the person next to you just to check if he isn't a hologram. Ever wondered how changing patterns on a screen can amaze you with music. You will witness a new groundbreaking performance after watching our techno cultural show.
